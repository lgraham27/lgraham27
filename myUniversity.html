<p><h2>Quick Overview</h2></p>

        <br><h3>Hi, my name is Lateef Graham and the school I attend is New Jersey City University. NJCU is the home of the home of the Gothic Knights. Native to the city of Jersey City in the state of New Jersey.
Hence why its called New Jersey City University, they honestly could've chosen a better name but you get what you get.New Jersey City University (NJCU) is known for its academic programs, diversity, and impact on economic mobility. But we mainly know it as the reason why we can't do what we want.  NJCU's College of Arts and Sciences, Education, Professional Studies, and School of Business offer 59 undergraduate degree programs and 31 graduate programs, including emerging and interdisciplinary fields. I, for one, am persuiung a STEM degree in Computer Science and I'm currently on my last year so this is my final stretch and I hope it's the same for the rest of you. </h3></br>
